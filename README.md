## getRandomColor( ) explanation :  
We use the hexadecimal color code to pick up a random color  
We need a # followed by 6 digits  
The Math.floor() method rounds a number DOWN to the nearest integer.  
The Math.random() picks up a number between 0 and 1  
We multiply by 16 to pick up a number between 0 and 15  
Therefore, we select one of the 16 characters contained in the letters variable  
We repeat this operation 6 times to get our random hex color code
